Capstone Part 2: Getting Started (Hands-On)
Time-series
 data are commonly encountered in data science. In particular, the field of finance, 
signal processing
, weather and other fields regularly deal with data formatted in this way. The goal of this case study is time-series forecasting, which can be thought of as the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. So we could try to predict purchases, number of views or the feature most closely related to our business opportunity, revenue.

Tasks
State the different modeling approaches that you will compare to address the business opportunity.

Iterate on your suite of possible models by modifying data transformations, pipeline architectures, hyperparameters and other relevant factors.

Re-train your model on all of the data using the selected approach and prepare it for deployment.

Articulate your findings in a summary report.

Hint:  To standardize the approach across models ensure that your model predicts the next 30 days for any given point in time. For supervised learning, the total revenue over the next thirty days can be represented as a single number.
