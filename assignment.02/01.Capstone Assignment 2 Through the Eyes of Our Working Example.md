Capstone Assignment 2: Through the Eyes of Our Working Example

Our Story
The business opportunity has been defined and you have come to an agreement with leadership with respect to appropriate wording and testable hypotheses. This part of the case study will focus on the next two stages in the enterprise workflow, namely data transformations and models. This part of the workflow will be treated slightly differently than previous case studies as these are time-series data, but the general procedure and best practices remain the same. These materials will provide the necessary guidance so that you can apply one of the supervised learning approaches that we have already discussed. However, you will also be encouraged to explore some of the time-series modeling tools available.



The Design Thinking Process
It is likely at this point that your original hill statements have been augmented by even more hill statements resulting from multiple playback  sessions with the client and end users. The wording and testable hypotheses youâ€™ve agreed to would be spelled out in a set of hill  statements. A set of hill statements that all relate to one specific project or business challenge is referred to as an epic. At this point your team would likely have composed an epic made up of specific hill statements related to different aspects of the project.
