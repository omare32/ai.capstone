About the Data
The data for this case study come from the 
online retail data set
 and are available through the 
UCI Machine Learning Repository
. The original data were published as a study that used 
RFM model
 to explore customer segmentation in the data set [1]. The data presented in this study are derived from this data set with simulated features and re-named columns to align with the AAVAIL case study.

The deliverables in part 1 are directed towards the business stakeholders. Feel free to use slides, a report, a RISE presentation or any format that aligns with your enterprise and/or work environment.

Note: We do not provide a notebook to guide you through this case study as we have done with the previous ones, because a major goal of this capstone is that it emulates a real world experience.
