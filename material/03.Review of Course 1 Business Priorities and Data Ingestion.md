Review of Course 1: Business Priorities and Data Ingestion
Process Models, Design Thinking, and Introduction
In this module you should have learned:

An example student for this course is a data science practitioners that has some foundation and some expertise building ML models

This course assumes some fundamental knowledge in linear algebra, probability, statistics, and Python programming

In Python it is expected that you have some experience with NumPy, matplotlib, pandas and scikit-learn

Watson Studio and Watson Knowledge Catalog make it easy to share code, data and collaborate on data science projects

OSEMN is an example of a simple process model and CRISP-DM an example of a more complex process model

The design thinking process can be naturally applied as a data science process model

Two advantages of design thinking in data science is that it is applied outside of data science and it encourages the inclusion of domain experts and stakeholders

All process models work to describe the business opportunity before anything else

All process models encourage feedback loops for iterative improvement

Data Collection
In this module you should have learned:

Stakeholder or domain expert opinion, feasibility and impact are three of the most important factors when prioritizing business opportunities

The practice of articulating a business opportunity, with the data in mind, as a testable hypothesis helps keep the overall project linked to the business needs

The notion of degree of belief is important when making statements both in science and in business. No statement has 100% degree of belief, it is some percentage of 100% that is a reflection of accumulated evidence

The scientific method helps formalize a process for rationalizing business decisions through experimentation and evidence

Data Ingestion
In this module you should have learned:

The fundamental parts of a data ingestion pipeline are:

Gather all relevant data from the sources of provided data

Implement several checks for quality assurance

Take the initial steps towards automation of the ingestion pipeline

Data engineers and data scientists have the most overlap in job duties when the data is being collected and when models are deployed. This is particularly true when it comes to automation.
