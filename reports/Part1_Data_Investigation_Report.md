## 1. Business Scenario Analysis

### Current State
AAVAIL has successfully piloted an à la carte billing model outside the US market, generating substantial transaction data across 38 countries. However, management currently relies on manual, time-intensive methods for revenue projection.

### Business Opportunity
**Primary Goal**: Create an automated service to predict monthly revenue at any point in time  
**Secondary Goal**: Enable country-specific revenue projections  
**Target Scope**: Focus on top 10 revenue-generating countries  
**Expected Impact**: 
- Reduce manager time spent on manual forecasting
- Improve accuracy of revenue projections
- Enable better staffing and budget planning decisions

### Success Metrics
- Model accuracy within 10% of actual monthly revenue
- Reduced forecasting time from days to minutes
- Country-specific predictions for top 10 markets
- Automated pipeline requiring minimal manual intervention
