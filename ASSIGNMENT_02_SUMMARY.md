#### 2. Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)
**Purpose**: Triple exponential smoothing for trend and seasonal patterns
**Implementation**:
- Automatic selection of additive vs multiplicative seasonality
- Optimized smoothing parameters (α, β, γ)
- Damped trend option for conservative forecasting

**Performance**:
- MAPE Range: 10-20% across countries  
- Best for: Stable seasonal patterns with moderate trends
- Limitations: Sensitive to outliers

- Hyperparameter tuning via grid search
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting

**Performance**:
- MAPE Range: 5-14% across countries
- Best for: Capturing complex temporal dependencies
- **Winner**: Selected as best overall model

#### 5. LSTM Neural Network (Optional)
**Purpose**: Deep learning for complex sequence modeling
**Implementation**:
- 2-layer LSTM architecture

**Selection Criteria**:
1. Lowest average MAPE across all countries
2. Consistency of performance (low standard deviation)
3. Computational efficiency for production deployment
4. Model interpretability and business acceptance

**Winner**: **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
